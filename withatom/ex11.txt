1. What is uniq command in unix?
    It is a command line utility for reporting or filtering repeated lines in a file.
    It can remove duplicates, show a count of occurrences, show only repeated lines,
    ignore certain characters and compare on specific fields.
    (The command expects adjacent comparison lines so it is often combined with the sort command.)
    ( THE FILE WHICH DOESNOT HAVE ADJACENT OCCURRENCES OF THE LINES NEED TO SORTED BEFORE PASSING
    TO THE UNIQ COMMAND)
    ---> UNIQ COMMAND RETURNS THE UNIQUE OCCURRENCES OF THE LINES AND PRINTS THE OUTPUT ON STANDARD OUTPUT.
    ---> PASSING A FILE TO UNIQ WHICH IS NOT SORTED WILL SIMPLY PRINT THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE.
    ---> IT CAN ALSO OUTPUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A LINE OCCURS IN A FILE.
    ---> IT CAN ALSO SHOW ONLY THE REPEATED LINES.
    ---> IT CAN ALSO SHOW LINES WHICH ARE NOT REPEATED.
    ---> IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO SKIP THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS FOR COMPARISON.
