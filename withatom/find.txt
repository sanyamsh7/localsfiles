ex6 Things To Do:
General format:
-->   find . -name *.txt -print
   (the above command finds the file of type .txt in the current directory and
    prints those file on the terminal.)
1. figure out what is find command of shell(done)
2. what are the flags used in find command(done)
    (i am only implementing -name, - type, -exec, -print, -. (dot))
3. create a py file for this exercise(done)
4. A flag -name or -type flag(-type d means to find directories with given name
    or -type f means type file like powershell.)(done)
  which contains the name of the file to search for.(done)
5. A flag -print to print the contents of the file.(done)
6. A directory to start searching in like ( . >> dot searches in the current(done)
        directory or if a path is given then it searches in the that directory.)
7. A flag -exec to execute useful things like if we want to delete a file then
-->   find . -name *.rb -exec rm {} \; ( this deletes the files of type ruby.)(remaining)
8. how to delete a file in python(done)
9. create a directory with some empty files in it to work on.(done)
10. Look for subprocess module and glob module late on after implementing this
    with argparse module.(remaining)
11. how to find files using python(done      
12. What is nargs = "+" in argparse?
    (this is used to give n number of arguments to a command it returns a list
     of all the arguments.)
13. What is metavar?
    (it provides different name for the optional argument, similarly --> dest)
14. Also look at the os module if that helps but after 45 min.
    (currently no using the os module. now trying to use other modules like:
      glob and pathlib)

15. how to delete a file in python(done)
  use .. os.remove(filename or path)
16. Understand the glob module and try to use it.(done)
17. Understand Path method from pathlib module.(done)
18. What are the other path manipulation libraries?(done)
k    (os.path , pathlib, shutil, glob, os)
19. Make a function only for all the arguments.(done)

20. Make a function find(arg) with arg as parse_args() this function will contain
    all the decision making of the arguments.(done)
21. Make a function for finding file with name(done)
22. Make a function for type of file(done)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for find2.py-------
1. Refactor the entire code of find.py and re-implement the better version of it.
2. Implement the -exec flag along with others
3. Use command with exec like delete and count(to count the number of files.).
4. Try implementing the search for the directories.
5. Figure out what are is_file() and is_dir() methods, use them.
6. Use another another logic to join paths rather than using joinpath().
7. Implement a path argument which takes the path of the directory to search
     for the file specified.
8. glob module only searches for files and directories in current location
  try not using that.
