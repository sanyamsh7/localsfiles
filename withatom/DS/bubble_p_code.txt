pseudo-code for bubble sort:
procedure bubblesort( A : list of sortable items)
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        swapped = false
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
        # if this pair is out of order
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
              #swap them and remember something changed
              swap(A[i-1], A[i])
              swapped = True
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
end procedure
