Things To Do:
1. study about the sort command.
    *) sort command sorts the content of a file line by line.
    *) it supports sorting alphabetically or in revers order or by number or by
      month or can also remove duplicates.(done)
    *) sorting is done based on one or more sort keys extracted from each line
      of input.
    *) by default, the entire input is taken as sort key. Blank space is the
      default field separator.
    *) lines starting with a number will appear before lines starting with a letter.(done)
    *) lines starting with a letter that appears earlier in the aplphabet will
      appear before lines starting with a letter that appears later in the alphabet.(done)
    *) lines starting with a lowercase letter will appear before lines starting
      with the same letter in uppercase.
    ---> OPTIONS....
          -O OPTION: IF YOU WANT TO WRITE THE SORTED OUTPUT TO A NEW FILE. THIS ALLOWS US
                     TO SPECIFY AN OUTPUT FILE.(DONE)
                     EXAMPLE: sort -o output.txt input.txt
          -r OPTION: SORTING IN REVERSE ORDER.(done)
                     EXAMPLE: sort -r inputfile.txt
          -f OPITON: TO SORT BY IGNORE CASE.(DONE)
          -g OPTION: TO SORT BY THE NUMERICAL DATA.(done)
2. Implement all the above in 45 min (ALSO THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS TOO.)
3. Create a text file with content in random order.
4. Read the file.(done)
5. Try sorting the text by using sorted and sort and see the difference in both.
    (don't use sort as a sorted object is required for data manipulation)
6. Sort a file based on lowercase letters only.(done)
7. Sort a file based on both uppercase and lowercase letters.(done)
