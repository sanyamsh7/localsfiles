Things To Do:
1. Implement sed command of UNIX in python.
2. Research about the sed command.
    ("sed" in UNIX stands for "stream editor". it can perform alot of functionality on
    a file find and replace and insertion or deletion. Most common usage is to find and
    replace strings. With sed we can edit files even without the need of opening them.
    This command also supports regular expressions.
3. syntax?
    --> sed OPTIONS.. [SCRIPTS] [INPUTFILE...]
    examples: sed 's/unix/linux/' somefile.txt
           \..> this means s --> for substitution operation
                           / --> delimiter
                           and replace unix with linux
    basically: sed s/string to replace/ string to replace with file_name
    BY DEFAULT IT SED COMMAND REPLACES THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF THE WORD IN THE LINE.
    *) FOR REPLACING THE NTH OCCURRENCE OF THE WORD WE USE:
        sed 's/unix/linux/2' somefile.txt
        ---> this replaces the second occurrence of the word unix in file somefile.txt
    *) TO REPLACE ALL THE OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD WE USE:
        sed 's/unix/linux/g' somefile.txt
        ---> g means global replacement
    *) TO REPLACE FROM NTH OCCURRENCE TO ALL THE OCCURRENCE OF THE WORD:
        sed 's/unix/linux/3g' somefile.txt
        ---> this replaces from third occurrence to all the occurrence of the word.

4. Have all the command line options for sed basic usage of replacing one string with another.(done)
5. Enable regular expression functionality in those command line options.
6. Make useful functions like sed() and parse_arg()
7. Implement for the first occurrence of the word.
8. Implement for the Nth occurrence of the word.
9. Implement for a range of occurrence of the word.
