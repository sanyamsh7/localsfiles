Things To Do:
implementing cut tool of unix.
1. Read about the working of cut tool.(done)
    syntax: cut [options] [file]
2. Add arguments for file name input and simply print the file content.(done)
3. Add an argument for fixed width (-c)(done)
    example: cut -c 5-10 file1
    this will extract the characters 5 to 10 from each line.
4. Add an argument for delimiter -d. This will extract the second and sixth field from
    each line, using the ";" character as the delimiter(by default it is tab)(done)
    example: cut file1.txt -d "," -f 2,6
    -d --> for delimiter and -f --> lets you choose the fields you wanna display.
5. Use webcam this time to analyse how you work and also try to use screen recorder
  if that helps.(done)
6. Now set strict time limit of 45 min and see how much of the tool you can implemen.(done)
7. Whats the impact of unicode on my implementation.
8. Print the number of words given to -c flag.(done)

BUGS:
  Indexing of the words printed ont he terminal is from zero.
  If the lines in the text file are shorter then the upper limit given to -c flag
  then it prints the spaces after the line ends.
