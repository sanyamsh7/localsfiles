1. data in python is represented by objects or by relations between objects.
2. every object has 3 things: 
	an identity 
	a type 
	a value 
3. an object's identity (or address in memory ) never changes.( method id(x) gives the address where the (x ) is stored.
4. an object's type is also unchangeable.(once the object is defined),
5. value of some objects can change(mutable and immutable objects)
6. an object's mutability is determined by its type.
7. Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected
8. should always close files explicitly
9. It is understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually a close() method (or use with statement)
